    <p>Over the past 20 years, medical technology has seen a tremendous growth. According to a recent study, medical
        technology has evolved more in the last 20 years than in the past thousand years. The same growth is also
        imminent in the total number of hospitals being established. <br>
        There have been many consumer complaints registered against hospitals and medical professionals regarding
        medical negligence, improper diagnosis, unfair billing for medical services and many more. These complaints have
        increased drastically over the past years in Bangalore, Mumbai, Pune, New Delhi, Chennai and almost all the
        cities in India. <br>
        Over the past few years, medical negligence, unfair billing has become a quite common term. Medical negligence
        or medical malpractice, as the term suggests, relates to the process when a medical or health care professional
        deviates from standards in his or her profession thereby causing grievous injury to the patient. <br>
